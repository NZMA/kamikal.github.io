# other information~

'tab2' only works on 1920x1080 and higher. 1440x900 may work, i've not been able to try it.

'tab5' is based on 'start page 2' by tayumpee https://github.com/tayumpee/start_page2_firefox_and_chrome as was a trend in /stpg/ for a while after it was posted. 'tab7' is also based on this.

~~'tab6' only works correctly on screen resolutions bigger than 1366x768, i'll fix this eventually.~~ this has been sort of fixed. removed one box, shrunk length of searchbar. it can be easily changed manually if that suits your needs.
