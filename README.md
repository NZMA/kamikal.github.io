# other information~

SEARCH BOX SYNTAX

~i is google images

~y is youtube

~n is nyaa.se

~t is torrentz.ey (rip)

~m is tcgplayer

this applies to pretty much all my pages.

~~      ~~

'tab3' only works on 1920x1080 and higher. 1440x900 may work, i've not been able to try it.

'tab5' is based on 'start page 2' by tayumpee https://github.com/tayumpee/start_page2_firefox_and_chrome as was a trend in /stpg/ for a while after it was posted. 'tab7' is also based on this.

~~'tab6' only works correctly on screen resolutions bigger than 1366x768, i'll fix this eventually.~~ this has been sort of fixed. removed one box, shrunk length of searchbar. it can be easily changed manually if that suits your needs.

no tabs are added in order of creation. i have tab pages from years ago that i might upload. 'tab1' being my most recent, 'tab2' being from about a year ago.

'some_bullshit' is unfinished. don't bother with it just yet. it is based off of: https://github.com/Usuka/Homepage
however, all the code is my own. i somehow managed to coincidentally share a lot of the same code with it. (some heights, widths, ~~and colours~~, however are from that pages code). i just thought the colours were nice.

'new2' is very unfinished. i'll finish it eventually. works best on 1920x1080, don't use on anything lower than 1440x900.

'tab14' can switch between boxes of links by using num8 and num9. you can have less used links on the second box (id=hidden) or you can use it for 'special' links. search box uses the normal syntax.

(i have a fantasic naming scheme)
